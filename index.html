      <h3>Team Name: HAQGroup</h3>
      <p>HAQ Group was formed at the beginning of the project. The name HAQ comes from the first letter in the name of our group members, H for Han, A for Anh, and Q for Quang. </p>

            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>My name is Tran Nguyen Ngoc Han and my student number is 3963227. I came from Tay Ninh city. Previously, I majored in Business, but then I realized that it was not the best fit for me, so I changed my major to Information Technology. This is my second semester with RMIT. During my free time, I love to play games, write blogs, listen to podcasts, and learn new programming languages. The more I learn about IT, the more I realize how important IT is to our world. From education, healthcare, transportation, to applications in businesses, it seems like IT has become a part of our daily lives. It is difficult to imagine a world without technology since it has been creating so many positive impacts on our lives. Therefore, I would like to become a part of it and make our world a better place.</p>
              
            <h3>Experiences</h3>
            <p>Prior to this project, I have been working with Python, Java, and binary numbers. Moreover, I have been using SQL to create a College Database application using Oracle Apex last semester. Besides, I have taken the Introduction to Computer System course that allowed me to come up with projects that involve the usage of Micro:bit, ESP32, and Arduino Uno. The User-Centered Design course also helped in creating a clearer picture about how websites work and why user-friendly designs are essential. Regarding website design, I have been taking Youtube courses relating to basic HTML and CSS programming. I hope that these IT experiences will grease the wheels of this project and become an advantage to my team.

            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>My name is Le Dang Quang with the student number 3977794. I am based in Tay Ninh province. However, most of the time I lived in Ho Chi Minh city for educational purposes. In my spare time, I usually spend time on studying new things, playing games, doing housework, working out and love to cook. In my high school years, I always wanted to become a pilot but with my low eye condition, I had to give up the dream and started to wonder what career suits me best.</p>
              
            <h3>Experiences</h3>
            <p> Until the end of high school, I had encountered coding and I loved it. I also did a lot of research about IT and Artificial Intelligence. I love the way that machines make human life much easier and more comfortable. So, I started to learn some basic programming of C++, C, Python, and HTML. I pretty much enjoy the online course at home. In addition, I have good listening skills that can support me in collecting feedback from group members and others. Thus, I hope all lessons that I learn will be useful in the future.

        <p>The HAQ group was formed at the beginning of the assignment. Although we were strangers and have not worked together before, everyone still succeeded in maintaining an effective team environment. It is difficult for us at the beginning to assign tasks to members because we do not know what are the strengths and weaknesses of everyone. However, thanks to the honesty of the team members during meetings, we gained a better understanding of each other and the tasks were assigned to the most suitable people. In general, everyone in our group is kind, helpful, and respects each other. Therefore, there are very little to no conflicts needed to be resolved among teammates.</p>

        <h3>Quang's career plan</h3>
        <p>I have been thinking about my future career since high school and it was quite hard to decide. However, I am looking forward to becoming an AI engineer where I find the most interest. So, I am now trying my best to fulfill that career plan. From online suggestions, I am planning to master Python, Java, Javascript and C++ as the main languages. In addition, I will learn some SQL, HTML & CSS, and algorithms which may be helpful for me, so I can make sure that I got the foundation which will benefit me in the future. Those things are not the only skills I need to achieve, I still have to improve my soft skills as well. Soft skills are another way that lead people to success. Those crucial skills are communication skill, collaboration skill, time management skill, critical thinking skill and many other skills. It will take a lot of effort not only for me, but also for those who took the same path with me and I am ready for it.

        <p>I have been interested in Artificial Intelligence ever since I first heard about it, and that interest has never changed. I have decided to learn about this minor but I haven't decided on a specific career yet. I only know about AI and far from understanding it, so , I deemed that making a decision now is too soon, I may overlook many opportunities that suit myself better. But , there still are some fundamental skill set that I need to master if I wish to work in this field:</p>

        <p>
          Overally, we all have different future career plans, but Quang and Tho Anh might share the same path as they are both interested in Artificial Intelligence. On the other hand, Han is focusing on the data and cloud technologies field. Even though we have different plans, the technical skills and soft skills requirements for everyone are quite similar. In particular, either field requires deep understanding about specific programming languages and algorithms.
