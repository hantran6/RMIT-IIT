        <h3>Group reflection</h3>
        <p>The benefit of a group is that the processes can be divided equally between each member which will not overwhelm a specific member. Furthermore, the team member can contribute ideas. Each member has a different point of view, so it can make the project diverse. There are some issues at the mid stage of the project. One of our members did not learn HTML & CSS before, so we had to come up with the idea that we had to design their part in a different software and then linked it together at the end. It is to make sure that everyone gets a chance to work on their given parts. Later on, the miscommunication between Tho Anh and the group members caused the group processes to be slowed down. However, we were able to keep up when Tho Anh showed his work. Our group had managed the issues calmly and friendly. Due to the first time approaching this issue, we do not really know what to do. For the next time, we would do it differently. When there is a member not communicating and keeping up with the group task well, we should notify the teacher of the issue first. Moreover, with those who don’t do their given task, we will also notify the teacher to consider removing that member out of the group. </p>
        <p>Overall, the group processes are lately being kept on task and updated. The most successful part is the group website that we had made. It illustrated our general idea about the project. </p>

                <p>For this Introduction to IT class, at first, I was not sure what this class was about. However, later I realized that the class is like an orientation of the IT world. It is where we can get to know the basic knowledge of technologies around us. This is the first project that I got in the first year of university. At first, I thought it would be easy because I felt that there was a lot of spare time for me everyday. However, I started to have another class project as well. It did give some time management pressure. I seemed to be the person who texted in the group chat the most. I always wondered if it would be fine for me to text that amount of content and not annoy other teammates. Overall, my parts were done completely. I need to improve my grammar, vocabulary, and the structure for my future report. If there are any chances of creating a website, I think I will need to improve the web design. I need to look for a trending style and format.</p>
                <p>The project was well on task at the beginning, but later on, there were several problems with the work division and team communication. I mainly got the problem with Tho Anh the most. Firstly, he had done so badly in team communication. Tho Anh and I were assigned to do the project prototype. We then divided the job equally for each other. Later on, I asked him to update his progress on Team, but he did not reply for a long time. It was quite annoying to me because he was not updating his work and he was not even replying to the chat. Later, I knew that he had only finished one part of the project prototype, so for the rest of the project, I had to cover it for him. However, in the end, we managed to finish all of the goals that we set in the beginning. </p>

                <h3>Hoang Tho Anh</h3>
                <p>Hi, this is Hoang Tho Anh s3979126’s reflection of “Our IT world” project. Throughout this project, I have encountered countless challenges . In order to have this outcome, I have modified , abort and testing a lot with every single functions, some failed, like this one: I wanted to make a real time tracking and report the status of the place, in my attempts to made it come true, I needed to modify it a lot: I wanted to set the defaults is the current time and the user can change the time they want, and if the time is similar to the "crowded time" set at the place, then that place won't be displayed. But that doesn't work, I don't know how to make it work at the end of the day. So I just display the "crowded hours" instead and have the user check by themselves. Some succeed, like this one: Making the review section is quite challenging too, because everything inside an item is a loop, I can't figure out how to undo some part of it without touching everything else so it was a little tricky.</p>
                <p>If I simply just put the review section in normally, whenever someone try to post a review, it will spread like covid-19, to every other section while it should only remain in one section only, for example, if I leave a review like:" nice restaurant" at restaurantA so not only does it appear in restaurantA’s page, it will also appear in restaurantB,restaurantC,MallA,MallB... pages , and that's no good. So, I decided I will make a page only for review and then put a button there at the main page to link to the review page.But I feel like it wasn't enough so I embed the review page inside the place's page, I'm so glad that it work.But there currently only 1 review page, so everything on the other page still links back to it, but once we have the other pages, things should work fine.</p>
                <p>At the end of the day, I realized things I did weren't really hard nor really complicated , it's just I didn’t know a thing, don't know where to start and whenever I assume something works one way, it's not gonna work that way. Basically, it's all about how I understand things. I misunderstanded things so many times while doing this, that's why I struggled a lot while doing this project. And that is why a plan is really important though barely anything goes as planned in my case. However, it provides a start point and a goal point. In my case, it's like I am a yoyo and the plan is the string that holds me back when everything else tries to throw me away as far as they can. Just go, and then somehow, you will reach your goal someday, that is what I have learned after this project.</p>

                <h3>Tran Nguyen Ngoc Han</h3>
                <p>At the beginning of the assignment, everything went smoothly as everyone was active in group communication, so we began setting deadlines and working on our assigned tasks very slowly. However, when deadlines from all of the classes came, we started to fly off the handle. A lot of tasks exceeded the assigned deadlines, which resulted in a horrific shift in our plans and progress. Moreover, it is hard for us sometimes to keep up with each other's task status because some members failed to update their progress and keep up with the group communication. This issue has created a burden on other group members as we have to wait for everyone to finish their workload in order to move on to the next step. Personally, I am overconfident about some of my teammate’s ability, so I expected them to perform tasks that were out of their capability, which lead to many negative effects on our overall performance. In future projects, group communication is something that I should keep an eye on and immediately take action when any team member has suspicious behaviors such as ignoring team messages. I should also spend more time with my teammates to understand their abilities in order to avoid overexpectations. Time-management skills are also something that I should improve. </p>
                <p>Other than that, I have learned a lot while helping Quang with his code for our product website prototype. Although I learned HTML and CSS programming on Youtube prior to the course, there are many new things that were introduced that surprised me since I have never worked on it before and helping Quang give me a chance to learn more. Overally, I am satisfied with our project as we managed to finish almost every goal that we set, despite all of the struggles we faced.</p>
