      <p> For the purpose of the project, we created a group website and a repository for our group. The content of the group website is similar to this report’s content. Besides, we also created a website as a prototype for our product.  </p>

      <h3>comments</h3>
      <p>Our group project required two websites. One website is for the report content and the other is our product prototype. Han is responsible for the report website, while Quang and Tho Anh worked on the product prototype. Since each of us is working on different websites, we have different repositories. Although we shared the repo with each other to see the progress, we did not really intervene with each other's code. Therefore, the audit trails are pretty much personal updates. Moreover, since Tho Anh is using Wix to support his part, we could not see the audit trails for Tho Anh’s part. </p>

        <!-- question 1 -->
        <h3>What functionalities does your IT system/product have?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Personality Test</li>
          <li>Booking hotel and flight tickets</li>
          <li>Display entertainment destinations</li>
          <li>Review </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- question 2 -->
        <h3>Details on how these functionalities work?</h3>
        <p><u>Personality Test:</u> We want to offer customers to take an optional personality test, which an AI will assess in order to understand the user’s preferences and provide the best suggestions. This AI will also keep track of the areas they visit the most and utilize that information to improve the suggestions.</p>
        <p><u>Booking hotel and flight tickets: </u> We will direct the user to a page where they may book their hotel and flight. They may also keep track of their order. When there are issues with the booking, we can assist them at any time. </p>
        <p><u>Display entertainment destination:</u> We will always update the user with new places and events in the Service page. For who don’t want to take the personality test, they can go to the Service page and filter the option with the user’s preferences. </p>
        <p><u>Review:</u> Review feature is where the user can can leave the review of the experienced placed. We also push the review to the web, so everyone can see it. </p>
        

        <!-- question 3 -->
        <h3>How can it help to solve a real life problem?</h3>
        <p>The pandemic has left many negative impacts on the travel industry and the economy. Therefore, we wanted to ease the damage caused by creating a website that makes booking and traveling easier. </p>
        </div>

        <!-- question 4 -->
        <h3>Can we use it right away? Is it complete or still very basic/early stage?</h3>
        <p>Yes, the website can be accessed right away, but it is just a prototype version that is still in an early stage. Generally, a lot of features are categorized as out of scope due to the lack of knowledge, skills required, and time. However, we will come up with the demo version that is closest to the real design visualized. </p>

        <!-- question 5 -->
        <h3>What are the limitations and known bugs of the system?</h3>
        <p>Currently, we are focusing only on the mockup and prototype of the website. It means that users can click on it, but many features are just for demonstrations, it was not fully functional yet.  </p>
    
        <!-- question 6 -->
        <h3>What do you plan to improve, etc?</h3>
        <p>We are planning to improve the UI/UX design of the website so that it will be more user-friendly and can be easily accessed by everyone. Moreover, when we have more knowledge about how data science works, an AI with machine learning ability will be designed in order to analyze the user's personality and come up with more suitable recommendations. Besides, our search engine needs to be improved and other features in the out of scope section will be added too.  </p>
