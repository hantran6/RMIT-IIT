            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>My name is Tran Nguyen Ngoc Han and my student number is 3963227. I came from Tay Ninh city. Previously, I majored in Business, but then I realized that it was not the best fit for me, so I changed my major to Information Technology. This is my second semester with RMIT. During my free time, I love to play games, write blogs, listen to podcasts, and learn new programming languages. The more I learn about IT, the more I realize how important IT is to our world. From education, healthcare, transportation, to applications in businesses, it seems like IT has become a part of our daily lives. It is difficult to imagine a world without technology since it has been creating so many positive impacts on our lives. Therefore, I would like to become a part of it and make our world a better place.</p>
              
            <h3>Experiences</h3>
            <p>Prior to this project, I have been working with Python, Java, and binary numbers. Moreover, I have been using SQL to create a College Database application using Oracle Apex last semester. Besides, I have taken the Introduction to Computer System course that allowed me to come up with projects that involve the usage of Micro:bit, ESP32, and Arduino Uno. The User-Centered Design course also helped in creating a clearer picture about how websites work and why user-friendly designs are essential. Regarding website design, I have been taking Youtube courses relating to basic HTML and CSS programming. I hope that these IT experiences will grease the wheels of this project and become an advantage to my team. </p>

            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>My name is Le Dang Quang with the student number 3977794. I am based in Tay Ninh province. However, most of the time I lived in Ho Chi Minh city for educational purposes. In my spare time, I usually spend time on studying new things, playing games, doing housework, working out and love to cook. In my high school years, I always wanted to become a pilot but with my low eye condition, I had to give up the dream and started to wonder what career suits me best. </p>
              
            <h3>Experiences</h3>
            <p>Until the end of high school, I had encountered coding and I loved it. I also did a lot of research about IT and Artificial Intelligence. I love the way that machines make human life much easier and more comfortable. So, I started to learn some basic programming of C++, C, Python, and HTML. I pretty much enjoy the online course at home. In addition, I have good listening skills that can support me in collecting feedback from group members and others. Thus, I hope all lessons that I learn will be useful in the future. </p>

            <p>Hi, my name is Hoang Tho Anh , my code name at RMIT is s3979126. I recently transferred to Ho Chi Minh City from Hanoi (mostly because of the facilities). And please, allow me to introduce myself to you, whoever the wonderful person is reading these lines.: From an objective point of view (16personalities), I am a Logician with a lot of curiosity. That’s quite true though, I have always been seeking for interesting things, and this field is full of it.</p>
              
            <h3>Experiences</h3>
            <p>I have started to have some basic concepts about IT ,programming,...  and it only piqued my interest even more, this is nowhere near enough. I want to learn more , I have to learn more, and I will not stop, not now, not ever.
