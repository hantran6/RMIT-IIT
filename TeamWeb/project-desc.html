      <p>Our group planned to develop a travel-planning website named Ameno Wanderer that recommended tourist attractions based on users’ personalities and preferences. The website will help the user locate the destination that meets the user’s interest, matches their lifestyles, and show them the directions to get there from their current position. It can show feedback and recommendations from other people in order to come up with the most suitable option for our users. From there, our users can plan their own trips by adding the locations to their schedules and enjoy their vacations or explore new places. 
      </p>

      <p> Planning for trips has never been an easy task as it is a time consuming mission that requires users to do a lot of research. Moreover, booking a tour through services is expensive and sometimes they are ineffective since many spots do not match the user's preferences. In such cases, Ameno Wanderers come in handy as it is simple and economical. Not only for foreigners, local residents themselves can find it useful as they can experience new places. For many people, it is difficult to decide what to eat, where to go during their free time, etc., so our group wanted to come up with Anemo Wanderer as a solution to this issue. Moreover, since COVID-19 has severely damaged the tourism industry over the past few years, we hope that Anemo Wanderer will somewhat lighten the situation by easing the process of planning for trips.

      <p>We got our idea for this project from an introductory talk of each member in the beginning of the semester. We share questions when it comes to food and entertainment locations, such as “Where do you usually eat a steam bun?”, “Do you know any quiet restaurants?”, and etc. Therefore, we would like to make an application that can instantly help our clients get their recommendation locations. It can solve many people's problems as well as our headache issue when it comes to selecting a place to hang out with each other.          
      </p>

      <p> We notice that many people, including us, usually have trouble finding a certain location (usually a restaurant or places to hang out ) that would fit our liking. Of course we would know some awesome places around our house by testing them all , but aside from that area, we barely know any . So, if even we ,the residents of the city,  are having this trouble, what about travelers from afar? Either finding decent places to visit or to eat is surprisingly more difficult than how it should be. Moreover, the most commonly used guides are articles from the internet which sometimes are promotion in disguise and most of the time giving inaccurate information, plus, the writer’s taste may be very different from the reader. That is our motivation for creating this project: Anemo Wanderer. The wind knows everything , it will lead people to the most suitable places for them, making each of their trips worthwhile: Easy and satisfying, as it should be.

        <p>Our group wanted to focus on developing a travel-planning website that will recommend the tourist attractions and locations to users based on their personality and preferences. In order to achieve this aim, the website must have the following pages: Home, About Us, Services, Booking, Review, Sign Up, and Contact. The description of these pages will be discussed below.</p>
