        <p>Our group planned to develop a travel-planning website named Ameno Wanderer that recommended tourist attractions based on users’ personalities and preferences. The website will help the user locate the destination that meets the user’s interest, matches their lifestyles, and show them the directions to get there from their current position. It can show feedback and recommendations from other people in order to come up with the most suitable option for our users. From there, our users can plan their own trips by adding the locations to their schedules and enjoy their vacations or explore new places.  
        </p>
  
        <p> Planning for trips has never been an easy task as it is a time consuming mission that requires users to do a lot of research. Moreover, booking a tour through services is expensive and sometimes they are ineffective since many spots do not match the user's preferences. In such cases, Ameno Wanderers come in handy as it is simple and economical. Not only for foreigners, local residents themselves can find it useful as they can experience new places. For many people, it is difficult to decide what to eat, where to go during their free time, etc., so our group wanted to come up with Anemo Wanderer as a solution to this issue. Moreover, since COVID-19 has severely damaged the tourism industry over the past few years, we hope that Anemo Wanderer will somewhat lighten the situation by easing the process of planning for trips.

      <p>We got our idea for this project from an introductory talk of each member in the beginning of the semester. We share questions when it comes to food and entertainment locations, such as “Where do you usually eat a steam bun?”, “Do you know any quiet restaurants?”, and etc. Therefore, we would like to make an application that can instantly help our clients get their recommendation locations. It can solve many people's problems as well as our headache issue when it comes to selecting a place to hang out with each other.</p>
  
      <p> 
        We notice that many people, including us, usually have trouble finding a certain location (usually a restaurant or places to hang out ) that would fit our liking. Of course we would know some awesome places around our house by testing them all , but aside from that area, we barely know any . So, if even we ,the residents of the city,  are having this trouble, what about travelers from afar? Either finding decent places to visit or to eat is surprisingly more difficult than how it should be. Moreover, the most commonly used guides are articles from the internet which sometimes are promoted in disguise and most of the time giving inaccurate information, plus, the writer’s taste may be very different from the reader. That is our motivation for creating this project: Anemo Wanderer. The wind knows everything , it will lead people to the most suitable places for them, making each of their trips worthwhile: Easy and satisfying, as it should be.

      <p>Some of the similar systems and products are: Tripadvisor, Expedia, Airbnb, Agoda, Booking.com, etc. Accordingly, these websites are the most used online travel agencies (SEMRUSH, 2022). While most of them focus on booking flights, hotels, and cars, Tripadvisor has extra features named “Things to do” and “Travel stories” that allow visitors to find recommended activities and specific information about a destination. However, these features were based only on the location itself and didn’t take into account the user's preferences. In other words, it only recommends the most popular and crowded sites, not the most suitable for visitors.  
      </p>

      <p> On the other hand, our website aimed to provide users with a custom-made recommendation that fit the user’s personality and preferences through filter checkbox and personality test. This can be done by asking users to take an optional personality test before surfing the website and an AI will take care of the analyzing processes and come up with recommendations. Due to the time limit, we do not have enough time to invest into the AI, so the filter checkboxes will be used as a temporary solution for our prototype.

      <h3>aims</h3>
      <p>Our group wanted to focus on developing a traveling website that will recommend tourist attractions and locations to users based on their personality and preferences. We aim to provide the user a friendly environment that can interact with us and our cooperating parties. Furthermore, Anemo Wanderer will be our client’s pocket buddy. Our 24/7 will be always available when the client needs any guidance. Thus, providing our client the best traveling experience is our priority task. </p>
      <p> First of all, the goal to achieve the aim is creating a travel website. The website includes Home page, Personality test Page, Service page, Review page, About Us page, and User Profile page. The Home page has an awesome introduction video about Ho Chi Minh city. Service page is the most significant page of all. Anemo Wanderer also has a Personality test page where the admin want to collect users’ personality that will aid It has a Booking page, Coffee page, and Transportation page as subsections in the Service page. The Booking page and Coffee page, which has a lot of features, is the main section of the Anemo Wanderer project. It contains the interacting environment between the user and the website’s manager. Transportation page is the page’s suggestion for the traveling methods in this area. Review page is where Anemo’s user can leave revision of their trip or a review of a specific location. About Us page is the introduction of the website page and the team members. Finally, the User Profile page is the location where the user can modify their information. </p>

            There are various transportation methods that you could use here in Vietnam. The most traditional one is the taxi. We got Mai Linh taxi and Vinasun taxi which are the oldest in Vietnam. This taxi company has proven their professionalism and reliability over the years. In Vietnam, we also got Grab, Be, and Gojek as our secondary transportation that you can select with more affordable price and quality. There are also places where you can rent a motorbike and wander around the area freely for a low-priced. We don’t suggest you take public transportation here because you might wait for a long time to get on it which makes the other transportation methods faster and more convenient.

          <td>
            <b>Have a Plan</b>
            Traveling is an exciting adventure, which is why we like it so much. But just because it's an adventure doesn't mean we should rush into it. 
            <br>
            I strongly advocate having a plan for your travel. You don't have to plan every minute of the day, but you should plan your arrival and departure, first night's lodging, transportation to your first night's lodging, and how to exchange currencies. 
            <br>

            <b>Handling Private Information</b> 
            <br>
            Tourists frequently repeat the same personal information when traveling. For instance, "My name is Jamie Perez, I'm 22 years old, I'm from Green River, Wyoming, and I work as an electrical engineer," for example. Those four factors are enough for many persistent people to swiftly discover you on social media and perhaps stalk you. 
            <br>
            Make your information more ambiguous, such as "My name is Jamie, I'm in my twenties, I'm from Wyoming, and I work as an engineer." You are now considerably more difficult to locate. I understand that the "getting to know you" chat is enjoyable when meeting new travel companions. You certainly may; just remember to keep your personal details unmemorable.
            <br>
            Furthermore, do not provide any details regarding your vacation. Don't tell anyone where you're staying or where you're going next. They don't need to know unless you expect to meet them again, and even then, be cautious!
            <br>

            <b>Aware of Stranger</b> 
            <br>
            Remember that no one with bad intentions would tell you that they intend to injure you. As a result, even while meeting new acquaintances, you must be alert of warning signs. Excessive personal inquiries, prolonged stares, and aggressive body language are indications that a person is not who they appear to be. You deserve to be protected, therefore never allow someone to put you in an unsafe situation. Leave if anything doesn't feel right. Staying in groups and never going out with strangers alone is the greatest approach to create new, safe friends. 
            <br>

            <b>Careful About The Food </b> 
            <br>
            Getting to experience new cuisines and drinks is one of the most wonderful pleasures of traveling. We may be more tempted to let free when we travel, but we cannot afford to overlook the same safeguards we would take at home. We are usually trained to be vigilant of food safety regulations in order to avoid becoming ill, but we occasionally forget that the threat might come from wicked persons. This is most typically encountered at pubs, clubs, and even during festivals. What should you do if you're in a pub and someone offers you a drink? Simply say NO if you don't want the drink. 
            <br>

            <b>Behave Well</b> 
            <br>
            You can't act like a complete stupid just because you're on vacation. Wherever you go, you must regard it as if it were your own home. Respect various cultures, avoid becoming trashed when drinking, and be kind to natives. You should also follow the same safety precautions that you would in any city in your native country. Avoid unsafe areas, plan your route, don't travel alone at night, keep all valuables hidden, and so on. Your safety should always be at the top of your priority list and influence your decisions.

      <h3>tools and technology</h3>
      <p>Our main softwares and tools for the project are GitHub,Wix and Visual Studio Code. In order to work with these platforms, it is recommended that members have prior knowledge and experiences with the following languages:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
        <li>Backend: JavaScript</li>
        <li>Others: UI/UX  design and technical skills</li>
      </ol>

      <p>From the User Centered Design course last semester, Han has some prior experiences with Github, Visual Studio Code, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and UI/UX designs. Before taking this course, Quang did some self-study and researches on HTML and how Visual Studio Code worked, so he is quite familiar with it. Tho Anh has acknowledged how to use Github and Visual Studio Code which he could aid in the web development process. Moreover, he is more familiar with Wix, so part of the prototype is done via Wix and the HTML of the page will be exported and merged with Quang’s progress.   </p>

      <h3>risks</h3>
      <p>At the planning stage, we planned to use Oracle Apex as our main tool to develop the prototype for the application. However, due to the time limit, it is difficult for our teammates who have not experienced Oracle Apex and the SQL language to catch up. Therefore, we have to switch our plan and move to utilizing the website platform as our teammates are more used to Wix, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. </p>

      <p>Another risk we found is that our members are not used to Github multi-editor. We have not experienced sharing a repository with multiple people, so it is hard to perform tasks such as pull, push, etc. Unwanted mistakes such as: overlapping files, code might not run properly when put together, overwriting other people's parts, etc. Therefore, we must be extremely careful with the mentioned above issue.  </p>

      </div>

      <h3>Group processes and communication</h3>
      <p>The main communication tools for our group are Microsoft Teams and school emails. We often inform our group members about each person's progress or changes made from different time periods through the Teams chat to make sure that everyone is on the same page. At the beginning, we planned to have two mandatory online meetings per week to assign tasks to everyone. However, after we distributed the workload to everyone, we did not feel like it was necessary to reassign tasks every week, so the number of mandatory online meetings was reduced to whenever all team members feel like it is required. We will hold offline meetings after the tutorial class every week in order to discuss relevant topics such as: updating our progress, ask for help if needed, re-assign workload, etc.</p>

      <p>If any conflict arises between members, we will host an offline meeting with the presence of a third party participant as soon as possible to cool down the situation and find the most suitable solution for both sides before things go beyond control.</p>

      <p>For members who failed to respond to the group communication, we will ask for the reason during the tutorial section and look for an immediate solution. In case a member does not show up at the tutorial section nor respond to our messages, we will send them a warning email via school outlook account. If the person keeps on ignoring our attempts to communicate, we will contact the professor for help. Further neglection will result in the consideration of eliminating that teammate from our team. </p>
